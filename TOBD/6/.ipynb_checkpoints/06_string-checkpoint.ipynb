      "this wonderful icing is used for icing cakes and cookies as well as for borders and art work on cakes.  it makes a delicious filling also between the layers of cakes and under fondant icing.  you can make roses but it takes 3 or more days to dry them depending on the humidity. \r\n",

      "there are many versions of “buttercream” icing. some are made with eggs and all butter.  some varieties, you have to cook your sugar to a softball stage.  others are 100% shortening or a combination of shortening and butter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "each decorator has his or her favorite.  i personally think that the best taste and textured recipe is the one that has you cook your sugar, add to whipped eggs and use pounds of butter per batch. but…. i live in a state that can easily be a 100 degrees for days on end during the summer and you know what butter does on hot days.  it melts!  a greasy puddle of melted icing on a cake plate is not something i want to look at or eat.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "your top notch decorators have a few options we don’t.  they have huge refrigerators to store their cakes in, and refrigerated vehicles that they can use to deliver decorated cakes. i even know a few that refuse to deliver at all. if you want their cake, you come and get it and it’s your responsibility if it melts.  these decorators don’t even turn on their ovens for a wedding cake for less than $2000.  \r\n",

      "0)----- this wonderful icing is used for icing cakes and cookies as well as for borders and art work on cakes.\n",

      "2)----- you can make roses but it takes 3 or more days to dry them depending on the humidity.\n",
      "3)----- there are many versions of “buttercream” icing.\n",
      "4)----- some are made with eggs and all butter.\n",
      "5)----- some varieties, you have to cook your sugar to a softball stage.\n",
      "6)----- others are 100% shortening or a combination of shortening and butter.\n",
      "7)----- each decorator has his or her favorite.\n",
      "8)----- i personally think that the best taste and textured recipe is the one that has you cook your sugar, add to whipped eggs and use pounds of butter per batch.\n",
      "9)----- but….\n",
      "10)----- i live in a state that can easily be a 100 degrees for days on end during the summer and you know what butter does on hot days.\n",
      "11)----- it melts!\n",
      "12)----- a greasy puddle of melted icing on a cake plate is not something i want to look at or eat.\n",
      "13)----- your top notch decorators have a few options we don’t.\n",

      "16)----- if you want their cake, you come and get it and it’s your responsibility if it melts.\n",
      "17)----- these decorators don’t even turn on their ovens for a wedding cake for less than $2000.\n",
      "18)----- the following recipes for buttercream icing hold up pretty well in the heat and humidity, but if you know that your cake will be out in very high temperatures, then don’t use any butter and use only a high quality shortening.\n",

      "23)----- butter melts somewhere between 88 and 98 degrees f. depending on the amount of fat in the brand.\n",
      "24)----- you can see that if you need to serve a pure buttercream decorated cake, on a hot august afternoon, you could have melted roses (and i do mean greasy puddles) on the tablecloth.\n",
      "25)----- this is when a good quality shortening will be a great blessing.\n",
